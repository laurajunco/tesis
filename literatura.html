					Human subjects: Should we rely on technology for transcendence?
				</a>

				<p> "Of course, in order to enhance something, there must first be a baseline from which to enhance it. This requires a discourse of normalization, an expectation of basic functionality—the average human has four limbs, can run so far for so long, can see objects at this distance, etc. Any functionality that falls below this baseline is disability, no longer the realm of enhancement and technological augmentation, but of medical therapies and technological assistance".
				</p>

				<p>  Even when the functionality of new tech is broadly applicable, it’s the augmentation fantasy that drives interest </p>

				<p> Disability as a state of the social environment rather than a state of the body. it also begins to reconfigure our understanding of performance, functionality, and human potential as necessarily interdependent </p>

				<p>  Disability is then located in the social structures, institutions, and relationships that fail to meet the needs of different bodies, rather than locating the failing in the bodies themselves </p>

					All technology is asistive: six design rules on disability
				</a>

				<p>  it’s a false divide to make a we/them: either able-minded, able-bodied, or disabled </p>

				<p> All people, over the course of their lives, traffic between times of relative independence and dependence </p>

				<p> a pervasive, near-obsession with averages and statistical norms about bodies and capacities has become a naturalized form of describing both individuals and populations </p>

				<p> All technology is assistive technology </p>

				<p> Instead of labeling some technologies and not others as assistive, let’s start like this: We’re all getting all kinds of help from the things we make. All kinds of help, all the time, for our many material and social and educational and political needs. Private needs and public ones. No one is exempt. Then the questions get really interesting: What can a body do? What needs are you interested in? Who might use which thing for what? Where might the surprises be? How might a familiar thing morph into something else altogether? </p>

				<p> Let the tools you make ask questions, not just solve problems. </p>

				<p> reject the notion that all bodies should conform to some standardized or performative ideal </p>

				<p> Let’s hope for objects that raise and suspend questions, and employ them alongside objects designed to solve problems. Then we can have a complex public conversation about needs and desires for interdependence. And about tools that provide assistance to every human body. </p>

					Examined Life - Judith Butler & Sunaura Taylor
				</a>

				<p> Physical accesibility leads to social accesibility and acceptance </p>

				<p> Normalizing standards of our movements </p>
				<p> we have a false idea that the able-bodied persons is somehow radically self-sufficient </p>
				<p> impairment = body constraints our own unique embodiments.
					Disability = social repression of disabled people, the disabling effects of society </p>

				<p> help is something that we all need and is something that is looked down upon in society </p>

				<p> gender and disability converge in a lot of different ways. both movements get us to rethink what a body can do </p>

				<p> violence against sexual and gender minorities comes down to how they use their body and what they do with their body parts </p>

				<p> how can someones style of walking embody the desire to kill them? </p>

				<p> do we live in a world in which we address each other in order to address our basic needs </p>
